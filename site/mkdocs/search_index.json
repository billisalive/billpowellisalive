            "text": "layout: page (moon)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHave you ever talked to a rock?  Most rocks are actually very smart, much smarter than your teacher.  If you can talk with a rock, you\u2019ll learn more in one hour than you\u2019ll ever learn in school.   \n\nSome people think the art of \u201crock-talking\u201d is impossible.  They\u2019re wrong.  If you know the secrets that I know, it\u2019s difficult, but it\u2019s not impossible. \n\nOf course, if you tell everyone you\u2019re going to go talk to a rock, some folks will say things like, \u201cBut rocks don\u2019t talk!\u201d or \u201cAre you feeling okay?\u201d or \u201cRocks are only good for eating!\u201d Don\u2019t worry.  They\u2019re wrong.  Rocks \ncan\n talk. \n\nBut how can you get one to talk to you?   \n\nFirst, here\u2019s some things \nnot\n to do.  \nDon\u2019t\n walk up to a strange rock and say things like, \u201cHey, rock,\u201d or \u201cWould you please help me study fractions, rock?\u201d  The rock will frown and not say a word.  It may even bite your toe.  Rock frowns are hard to notice unless you\u2019re an expert like myself, but rock bites are obvious to anyone!  \n\nIt\u2019s not that rocks aren\u2019t friendly.  Just imagine how you would feel if a huge monster walked up to you and said, \u201cHey, human.  Can you teach me to breathe?\u201d  Do you talk to strange creatures that ask dumb questions?  Rocks are the same way.  \n\nHere\u2019s another tip.  \nNever throw or kick\n a rock.  Imagine.  You\u2019re sitting quietly, not bothering anyone.  Then, all at once, there\u2019s an awful-smelling humongous monster all around you.  \nWhoosh!\n  You whiz through the air and plop down in some crazy place that\u2019s miles from your home.  You\u2019re lost, scared, and angry.  Then the monster stomps up and yells, \u201cHey, human.  Teach me how to scratch my head!\u201d   \n\nWould you help that monster?  Me neither.   \n\nOkay.  Now that you know what \nnot\n to do, it\u2019s time for the real secrets.  How \ndo\n you get a rock to talk?   \n\nThe first and most basic secret of rock-talking is quite simple.  Never talk to any rock until another rock introduces you. \n\nIsn\u2019t that easy? \n\nAlmost no one ever gets \nintroduced\n to a rock.  That\u2019s why rocks are so quiet around us.  They\u2019re just shy.   \n\nOf course, maybe you\u2019ve noticed a small problem.  \u201cWait,\u201d you say, \u201cIf I can\u2019t talk to a rock until I\u2019m already friends with another rock, how do I ever talk to my \nfirst\n rock?\u201d  \n\nWell, ah, if you noticed that, you\u2019re ahead of the game.  It took me three years and quite a few long, boring days to realize this problem.  Congratulations.  You\u2019re a natural. \n\nThe hard truth is that you\u2019ll need to find a \ndifferent\n way to meet your first rock.  Once you\u2019ve made one rock friend, you\u2019ll be a real member of rock society.  But to make that happen, you\u2019ll have to get creative.  Fortunately, I have another secret. \n\nThink about it.  How do you make friends with people?  Of course.  You do things together.   \n\nSo here\u2019s the second secret.  To make friends with your first rock, politely invite it to join you in an activity that you both enjoy. \n\nThis isn\u2019t as easy as it sounds.  Imagine a rock trying to do some of your favorite activities\u2013playing checkers, hiking, eating bananas.  Rocks may be smart, but there are many activities that they can\u2019t do.   \n\nIt\u2019s rude to ask a rock to join you in something it can\u2019t do.  The rock may get offended and refuse to say a word.  After a few thousand years, it\u2019ll forgive you and might want to talk.  Unfortunately, by then you may be dead or you and your family may have moved away.   \n\nSo what do rocks like to do? \n\nBasically, what rocks like best is to sit where they are.  They\u2019re very good at this.  They have contests that last millions of years.  (This is another reason not to move a rock.)   \n\nSo here\u2019s the third, biggest secret.  Crawl slowly up to a rock and whisper, \u201cMay I have the pleasure of sitting with you?\u201d  Nine rocks out of ten will be delighted.  When rocks are happiest, they can\u2019t speak.  If the rock doesn\u2019t talk right away, that\u2019s a good sign.  \n\nThe rare rock who wants to be left alone will probably be angry.  Don\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t yell.  When rocks are angriest, they can\u2019t speak.  If the rock stays quiet, just move on and try another rock. \n\nDid you notice that a silent rock may be either very happy or very angry?  You\u2019ve noticed another reason why so few people take the time to talk to rocks.  How can you tell whether a quiet rock is happy or sad? \n\nWhen I figure that out, I\u2019ll write another article. \n\nIn the meantime, if a rock is quiet, hopefully it\u2019s happy and it wants to sit with you.  So sit.  Don\u2019t move.  Rocks don\u2019t move much, and they distrust anything that does.  Be still. \n\nYou\u2019ll probably have to wait awhile before the rock talks.  Remember, rocks live for thousands of years.  They don\u2019t mind waiting.  Some books say that the average rock won\u2019t talk for at least six hundred years.  I think that\u2019s a little long.  If you\u2019re very still, your average rock will probably crack a joke after only three or four hundred years.  Be patient.   \n\nIt can be tough.  I once sat next to a rock for five whole years.  Then a flood washed us apart.  That was frustrating.  But I haven\u2019t given up.  As soon as I finish writing this article, I\u2019m going to walk right out and make friends with a new rock.  Why don\u2019t you do the same?  You\u2019ll be glad you did! \n\nOh, and here\u2019s one last tip.  I forgot to do this last time.  Bring some food.",

            "text": "UPDATE: 2012\n\n\n\nIn the eight years since I first visited \nRichard Fahey\n and wrote about his \"Catholic Homesteading Movement,\" several people have contacted me to tell me that he was and is an \nabusive father and husband\n. \u00a0\n\n\n\nYou can read some of this in the comments below. At first, I hesitated, suggesting that perhaps he was harsh, strict, etc., but not actually abusive.\n\n\n\nBut in further private emails, more than one of his children were emphatic. He was abusive.\n\n\n\nSince then, \nRichard Fahey's daughters have started a blog,\n chronicling his abuse.\n\n\n\nI believe them. I believe them because, on both my visits, his wife and children were excessively solemn, shy, nervous, and silent. Enough to make you uncomfortable.\n\n\n\nA reporter was there, and after politely asking him several questions, asked, \"What do your children think of all this?\" Mr. Fahey wouldn't let them say a word. He said they were not \"prepared\" to answer that.\n\n\n\nIs this enough to convict you of child abuse? No. But it is consistent with what an abusive family can look like when forced to deal with \"outsiders.\" It worried me even at the time. \u00a0\n\n\n\nSo if more than one of his children have since come forward to explain, in great detail, that he was abusive, I believe them. And it makes me very angry.\n\n\n\nAs I read through the daughters' short, tragic articles, other details ring true. In a \npost on sexual abuse\n, she claims, among other things, that there was no sexual privacy, even for using the bathroom. And this was true on both my visits. Somehow, Mr. Fahey could not be bothered to make an outhouse. The guest bathroom was a toilet in the clearing in the woods. \u00a0\n\n\n\nAs I mention in a comment below, for awhile I hesitated to repeat accusations of child abuse against someone who doesn't use the Internet and can't defend himself. However, it's clear from the daughters' blog that he is now aware that his online reputation needs defending. If anyone has a link to a statement he has posted online, \ncontact me\n, and I'll be glad to post it. But it won't hold much weight with me unless it is corroborated by one or more of his adult children.\n\n\n\nYou might wonder why, in light of all this, I would leave my old, complimentary article up. Because \nchild abusers excel at fooling adults.\n And until you've experienced the deception yourself, it is hard to believe that a real, live, child abuser could be so cordial and welcoming to your face.\u00a0\n\n\n\nRead the daughters' blog, then come back here and read how \"normal\" a casual visitor could make the same place sound.\n\n\n\nAlso, I have (finally) added a comment at the end which Richard's daughter\u00a0 Francesca sent me to post years ago. Instead, we emailed back and forth privately. \u00a0But I am finally ready to include it here.\n\n\n\nYes, there are witch hunters out there who are eager to call in Child Protective Services every time a tired baby cries in public. But I think there are a lot more of us who resist seeing what makes us uncomfortable. Meanwhile, children are helpless.\n\n\n\nEND UPDATE 2012\n\n\n\nLast Monday, I visited the \nCatholic Homesteading Movement\n in Norwich, NY. \u00a0This Movement consists of a nice, large, Catholic family whose only umbilical cord to the outside world is their mailbox (which, someone mentioned, used to be a barrel, although I didn\u2019t see it so I can\u2019t be sure). \u00a0\n\n\n\nNo phones. No electricity. No DSL line. Not even the obligatory satellite dish that adorns many an otherwise rustic lawn/appliance graveyard in our rural byways. \u00a0\n\n\n\nI was curious to find out how they live. I was disappointed. I didn\u2019t find out how they live. I was only there for around four hours, which is less time than it took to get there. I learned more about guessing which backroads match the unlabelled squiggles in my atlas than I did about daily homesteading life. But I did learn a bit about the course topic: buying land. And (get ready, here it comes) I learned a little about myself. \u00a0\n\n\n\nI would have been on time if it hadn\u2019t snowed. The last quarter mile separating the Catholic Homesteading Movement from the rest of New York happened to be under a foot of snow and rather steeply uphill. Fortunately, there were two other people just starting the trek as I arrived. I\u2019m glad they were there, because otherwise it would have been a bit lonely out there on the slope, surrounded by the extreme quiet of a bare wintry valley and ridges of grey hills \u00a0sternly surrounding me. \u00a0\n\n\n\nBut they were soon way ahead of me, and then it was lonely. It took about eight seconds for my side to start hurting, and as I painfully huffed my suburban self up the slope towards no visible goal and felt \noutside\n for the first time in months, I had an exquisite opportunity to ask myself just what the heck I was doing out here. What was I looking for? Here it was, \nnature\n, and I was cold, in pain, and running late. I couldn\u2019t formulate what I wanted, but I began to realize it had better be worth it. \u00a0\n\n\n\nSoon the road curved and I saw the little log cabin waiting for us. \u00a0It didn\u2019t wait long. I passed a goat that was tethered to a post in the middle of a field. It was giving the traditional bleat that means you are officially in the country. Then the rustic cabin door opened and I was inside. \u00a0\n\n\n\nWow. As the title suggested, this was not your usual rustic homesteader cabin. At least, it wasn\u2019t as far as I could tell, based on my limited acquaintance with the work of Laura Ingalls Wilder. This was probably the size of two bathrooms end to end, and it was smaller than some bathrooms I\u2019ve seen. The roof peaked at a sharp angle, leaving room for a small loft on either side. The floor was of large slabs of stone embedded in concrete(?), the walls were white plaster, and a short, squat wood stove the size of a large toaster was just ugly enough to keep unwise suburbanites like myself from sitting on it. If there hadn\u2019t been, say, nine people in the room, it would have been enchanting. It was still heavily intriguing. I shook hands with Mr. Fahey, smiled vacuously at everyone else, and let my eyes wander in delight at this crazy little house. \u00a0\n\n\n\nI never mentioned I\u2019d be writing anything while I was there, so I won\u2019t say anything about the other folks who came, not even the reporter, who was doing a story on something (he never said what) and made all of us a similar promise. In fact, it occurs to me that, despite the free publicity, Mr. Fahey himself might not be thrilled if I summarized his course, so the rest of this blog will be brief and distinctly episodic. \u00a0\n\n\n\nTwo major points to pass on here. First, Fahey began the course with a reading from Numbers 12 (or 13), in which God tells the Israelites just what to look for as they scout out the Promised Land. I never thought of the Israelites as homesteaders, but you know what, what else would you call them? Army? \u00a0\n\n\n\nSecondly, and slightly less profound (unless you can spin out a metaphor here), \ndrainage matters\n. You\u2019re probably thinking, \u201cOh sure, don\u2019t put the library at the bottom of the 85 degree hill. I knew that.\u201d WRONG. That\u2019s \nrunoff\n, where rain ends up thanks to the wonder of gravity. \u00a0\n\n\n\nWhat \ndrainage\n means is what the soil does with the rain before it runs off. If there\u2019s too little soil, the soil doesn\u2019t absorb the rain very well. After a downpour, you get those sloshy swamps that slurp up Sunday shoes, and then in a day or two the old swamp is bone dry. Neither of these conditions are good for crops, who aren\u2019t thrilled with the shallow soil to begin with because there\u2019s not much room for their roots to stretch, grow, and find self-actualization. Thus, if you have shallow soil that quickly ends in hardpan (a.k.a \u201cbrown concrete\u201d, courtesy of relentless tractor use) or just plain old bedrock, then you have what farmers in their subjective way dub \npoor drainage\n. Or \nbad drainage\n, that\u2019s fine too. \u00a0\n\n\n\nWhat the wide-eyed homesteader should instead seek is \ngood drainage\n, which if I remember aright means having at least 6 inches of good soil, if not much more. How can you tell if your soil has good drainage or bad drainage? \nRead the plants.\n Fahey took us around his snowy, windswept property, showing us the sparse tree growth and crooked branches that signalled poor drainage and the denser growth and straighter branches that showed good drainage. It was fascinating. What was just a background blur of trees abruptly had meaning. \u00a0\n\n\n\nRead the plants. I never knew you could. Now I\u2019m in kindergarten again, puzzling out my first ABC\u2019s. As we took that walk, I was shown a world where every plant could tell me something, whether the soil was acid or base, fertile or infertile, shallow or deep. Haltingly, I sounded out a few simple words from the tapestry of the world. \u00a0\n\n\n\nWe walked through a forest of evergreen hemlocks, and I realized that I was actually in the silent, snowy forest of pines that frequently haunts my imagination. Then all at once the pines stopped, and the forest became bare deciduous trees. I shrugged and didn\u2019t think to question it, but Fahey explained that something like that doesn\u2019t just happen; there\u2019s some major difference in the soil. Hardly an explanation, more a gesture in the direction of answer, but that little comment made me feel the world grow around me. The little bubble of coherence I in which I walk expanded past the whir of my own mind and the squawks of my fellow humans and touched the tips of the trees and the ground beneath my feet. \u00a0\n\n\n\nAfter a lesson on winter tree identification by Fahey\u2019s daughter, we adjourned to the half-cabin for fried bread nuggets, home-grown apples, and peppermint tea with the peppermint intact. I don\u2019t know why it is I don\u2019t believe people when they say something\u2019s hot. My tongue was still a bit raw when I got home five hours later. \u00a0\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t yet know if I\u2019ll be visiting again. They were friendly and their knowledge was obviously vast. But I sit and type this blog and think of all the people who could read it, and I think I\u2019ll probably be the homesteader who hooks up his own windmill and tries to run a server off a discarded satellite dish. Technology is abused and marvelous. \u00a0\n\n\n\nStill, the half-cabin rankles with me as a challenge. Just how far am I from the world God created and creates? How many layers of electricity and ease lie between me and the ability even to recognize His creatures, let alone feed myself? My wife\u2019s reading a book on having root cellar, and the author mentions that since even deer teach their children how to survive winter, we shouldn\u2019t do any less. It may be that the computer should be quaint to me, not the tree. I may have a long way to go to get there. \u00a0\n\n\n\nOn my way out the door, Fahey called, \u201cRead the book of Exodus.\u201d Why? Because everything the Israelites went through in the desert on their way to the Big Homestead was about to crash on me. I wonder if it\u2019s true.\n\n\n\nP.S. No, he didn\u2019t call it the Big Homestead. That one\u2019s all mine.\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \nguadalupe76\n says:\n\n    \nI\u2019m one of Richard Fahey\u2019s daughters. I find your blog very interesting. My dad is a crazy one. I was kicked out of there in 1994 when I was eighteen and not allowed back. Seven of my brothers and sisters have also left and are now living in freedom from his abuse. I wish visitors who go up to the homestead could know the real story about my father\u2014how he mentally and physically terrorized us. He looks and sounds like a wise, smart, kind man, but he has a dark sinister side. I\u2019m glad you only saw his good side. If you ever go up there, ask him what he thinks of his daughter Guadalupe Maria. Good luck and God bless your family!\nJanuary 22nd, 2006 at 10:57 pm\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nBill Powell\n says:\n\n    \nBill here. When an acquaintance recently expressed surprise over Guadalupe\u2019s post, it belatedly occured to me that Mr. Fahey is, of all people, singularly hampered in his ability to reply to this sort of comment online. I should have added a long time ago that I emailed Guadalupe before posting this comment, and in her reply she clarified her meaning a bit. I\u2019m not on my own computer, so I don\u2019t have her email by me; I don\u2019t want to soften her accusations, but on the other hand \u201cabuse\u201d and \u201cterrorize\u201d are words that shouldn\u2019t be left to our overactive tabloid imaginations, especially when the subject is a stern patriarch off in the countryside. No one was ritually tortured. You can laugh, but that was the first thing I thought. Thank you, television.\n\n    \nI honestly don\u2019t remember the exact details, nor am I sure she would want them online; I do remember that she described the sorts of parental faults you could find all too easily in any father (or mother) who errs on the side of discipline, authority, and his own extremely clear ideas. This isn\u2019t a justification; these are bad things to do. But they are neither exotic nor peculiar to counterculturals. And it is vital to point this out, because people are often all too ready to believe the worst of those who are deliberately different.\n\n    \nShe also wrote that her siblings had reported that her father had improved somewhat in recent years.\n\n    \nI\u2019m glad she wrote in, because it is true that Mr. Fahey presents his way of life as a model for families. I didn\u2019t see any such abuse on my two visits there, and he didn\u2019t advocate such behavior in his courses; on the other hand, when you present yourself as a model, perhaps you need to air your own shortcomings a bit to preclude the potenial for scandal. Not that I get on here and confess all my sins either.\n\n    \nStill, while I am consoled to think that this page doesn\u2019t quite have the hit count of Project Gutenburg, I hope no one has been misled into false fancies of a crazed homesteader. That would be grossly unfair to both father and daughter.\nAugust 26th, 2007 at 11:07 pm\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nBill Powell\n says:\n\n    \nEvery once in awhile, I get a request for an address for the \nCatholic Homesteading Movement\n.\u00a0 Here's the address that headed their 2007 Schedule:\nCatholic Homesteading Movement 21 Delaware Square Norwich, NY 13815\n    \nIf you send a\u00a0 SASE, you can get all sorts of information.

I hope all turns\u00a0 out well in the long run.\n\n    \nMy wife and I will being going back to the\u00a0 homestead this April. \u00a0I will attend the Fruit Tree Grafting course,\u00a0 while my wife attends the Spinning Workshop. We look forward\u00a0 to seeing your family and the homestead once\u00a0 again. \u00a0\n\n    \nBlessings,\n\n    \nLarry & Jackie Gilbert\n11 Mar 2008\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\u00a0 I have attended several of the CHM classes and have done some side jobs\u00a0 \u00a0 for them. I could tell when I met Richard, that he was a lot like my\u00a0 \u00a0 parents. Very knowledgeable and generous at times; but could have a\u00a0 \u00a0 tendency to be judgmental and a bit self-righteous. I learned with my\u00a0 \u00a0 parents how relate without conflict and knew to try to just stick to the\u00a0 \u00a0 topic at hand. There were only problems when I didn't do that.\u00a0\n\n    \n\u00a0 I loved their cabin and didn't find it too small, there are areas of the\u00a0 \u00a0 cabin that are off limit to visitors and I'm sure their home was big\u00a0 \u00a0 enough for their family. One person I have met thought the tool shed was\u00a0 \u00a0 their cabin and at first I thought you must have meant that too, but then\u00a0 \u00a0 when you spoke of the floors I knew you were describing their beautiful\u00a0 \u00a0 cabin. I sketched it out for my notes when I first saw it because I loved\u00a0 \u00a0 their fireplace area so much.\u00a0\n\n    \n\u00a0 I found Anna Marie and [child's name removed for privacy] to have the souls of an angel with their\u00a0 \u00a0 mild demeanor, though I wasn't always sure if I was talking too much and\u00a0 \u00a0 annoying them. So I tried to err on the quiet side.\u00a0\n\n    \n\u00a0 I have always learned so much from them, that even though he has made me\u00a0 \u00a0 cry a few times (though I don't know if he knows this, but he son saw), I\u00a0 \u00a0 kept going back. The last time was a bit much though and he hurt my\u00a0 \u00a0 feelings too badly for me to go back for a while, but I am pretty\u00a0 \u00a0 sensitive.\u00a0\n\n    \n\u00a0 We now only communicate via mail. We all have our faults and he has no\u00a0 \u00a0 way to defend himself here. I applaud him for trying to teach what he\u00a0 \u00a0 knows and open him self up to public criticism of their lifestyle.\u00a0 \u00a0 Something I don't know if I could do.\u00a0\n\n    \n\u00a0 Though I found some of their lifestyle to be unnecessarily harsh even for\u00a0 \u00a0 a homesteader, that was the route they chose and who am I to judge.\u00a0\n\n    \n\u00a0 I'm sure he was pretty harsh with his kids just like my Dad was, trying to\u00a0 \u00a0 keep us safe from the world and it's ways. My Dad was trying to save our\u00a0 \u00a0 lives and felt he was absolutely right, so he felt justified in his\u00a0 \u00a0 harshness and judgment. Then one day everyone grows up and leaves, and\u00a0 \u00a0 Dads get older. When that happens, sometimes they find out they didn't\u00a0 \u00a0 know everything and have some growing up to do for themselves.\u00a0\n\n    \n\u00a0 Jamie\u00a0\n23 Mar 2009\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nMy name is Gigi and my two daughters, Shanti and Chelsea, and I attended the week long homesteading workshop in 1992.\u00a0 We enjoyed our time there and often talk about it.\u00a0 We have always wondered how the family was doing and what life direction the Fahey children chose to take.\u00a0 It was good to find your blog to get some insight on what they are doing now.\u00a0 I think of them all often and wish them all the best in their lives.\u00a0 May God bless them.\n29 Mar 2009 \u00a0\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\u00a0 Hi!! My name is Dick (Richard) List. I stayed at the farm in 1969 \u00a0 and I visited in 2006. I would enjoy communicating with anyone about \u00a0 the farm. I think I have some insight, and I wish to learn more. I \u00a0 like Richard Fahey, but I did find him harsh.\n\n    \n\u00a0 www.richardlistcompany@gmail.com\n\n    \n\u00a0 Thanks!!!\u00a0\n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \nDear Mr. Powell, \u00a0\n\n    \n\u00a0Hello, My name is Francesca and I was born into the family of \u00a0Richard and Anna Marie Fahey. I read your blog on going to the \u00a0Homestead, and my two sister's comments. I would like to add my own \u00a0personal comment to that. I'm 24 now, and I've been gone from home \u00a0since 2001.\n\u00a0 I lived on the Homestead for 17 years of my life and put up with the \u00a0abuse and neglect for all that time. From the time I can remember to \u00a0when I left home, life there was a living nightmare. We were verbally \u00a0abused and threatened every day, and often didn't have enough to eat. \u00a0My biological father (I call him that because he wasn't a true \u00a0\"father\" figure) wasn't man enough to go out and get food for us, but \u00a0rather tried to completely rely on the food we grew. Many times there \u00a0just wasn't enough to feed all of us. I remember eating corn meal and \u00a0molasses from the feed store, and we ate boiled soybeans and whole \u00a0corn. It was in no way a healthy or balanced diet, and none of us got \u00a0enough to eat. I can remember often not having shoes or wearing shoes \u00a0that were way too small for me. We weren't taken care of when we got \u00a0sick, and I never went to the dentist when I lived there. \u00a0\n    \n\u00a0I was terrified of my father (I still am, actually), and lived in \u00a0constant fear that he was going to harm me. I remember laying in bed \u00a0at night too afraid to go to sleep, because I was scared that he was \u00a0going to hurt me. I'm sorry, but having these feelings aren't just \u00a0\"parental flaws,\" and real parents make sure their children have \u00a0enough to eat. They don't tell their children that they never wanted \u00a0to have any children, or that they hate them. I don't remember either \u00a0of my parents EVER telling any of us that they loved us. I don't \u00a0believe they ever did. There was no love in my household. It was all \u00a0about control, fear and breaking us down. I know I was severely \u00a0brainwashed. I couldn't think for myself. I couldn't express myself. I \u00a0was helpless. That was how we were raised. We weren't allowed to have \u00a0our own opinions or express our emotions. The only emotions I knew \u00a0were anger and hate. \u00a0\n\n    \n\u00a0 \u00a0I firmly believe that my father used this method of raising us \u00a0because he wanted us to think we could only \"Homestead\" and that we \u00a0couldn't do anything else in life successfully. He often told me, \u00a0personally, that I would never be successful NO matter what I did. He \u00a0doesn't care about anyone, but himself, and acts like he cares about \u00a0the family that sucks up to him and pretends to agree with him. \u00a0\n\n    \n\u00a0 \u00a0I know I'm my own person and refuse to be anything else. I left \u00a0when I was 17, because there was no way I could live under that \u00a0anymore. I was ready to die, and knew I would if I didn't get away \u00a0from the misery. Since then I have had little contact with him. He \u00a0hasn't bothered to keep in contact with me at all. I served in the \u00a0army for 3 years and did a year tour in Iraq. During that whole time, \u00a0he didn't write me once. He showed no concern what so ever! \u00a0\n\n    \n\u00a0 \u00a0With my sister, Maria, who wrote in, he disowned her because she \u00a0left home to become a nun. He called her rebellious, and picked at \u00a0every little thing that she did. He even went as far as to take her \u00a0off his literature on homesteading and said he had 11 children, \u00a0instead of the actual 12. He lied about her and made up stories about \u00a0her, so that he could make her sound bad to the family. This was when \u00a0I was 10. I didn't see her again until I was 18... 8 years later. This \u00a0hurt me so much... he tore apart of me away when he did that. Over the \u00a06 years I've had to get to know my older sister all over again... time \u00a0changes people so much! \u00a0\n\n    \n\u00a0 \u00a0And NO, Richard Fahey has NOT changed!! Just this year, he made a \u00a0big fuss about my older brother who is becoming a priest. He is upset \u00a0that my brother is driving a car and not growing his own garden. He \u00a0told my brother that he is a disgrace to the priesthood. He told my \u00a0brother that he has \"lost control\" over the past few years and that \u00a0his we have been coming and going as we please. He said no one was \u00a0allowed to go home unless they abided by his rules and stayed for a \u00a0week at least. He said we have to let him know and ask him in advance \u00a0if we can come home. He went as far as to tell [brother's name removed for privacy] that if he came to \u00a0visit that he wasn't allowed to go to daily Mass, even though it is \u00a0required for him to do so. \u00a0\n\n    \n\u00a0 \u00a0I could go on and on about this. Yes, there is much more and some \u00a0much worse stuff, but I just wanted to give you an idea of how \u00a0horrible he really is. I am hurt and am still angry about what he did. \u00a0He abused God's gift of children to him. Children aren't slaves, or \u00a0something that doesn't have feelings. I don't know where he is coming \u00a0from, but it isn't right, and he probably should be in jail for \u00a0everything he did to us. \u00a0\n\n    \n\u00a0 \u00a0This is NOT a case of \"bad parenting,\" but rather a case of no \u00a0parenting. He wasn't a father. I can't call him a father, because he \u00a0wasn't a real one. \"Any Fool can make a baby, but it takes a man to \u00a0raise a child\"--that is so true. \u00a0\n\n    \n\u00a0 \u00a0I love my brothers and sisters with all my heart and I'm grateful \u00a0for each and every one. I don't see anything wrong with homesteading. \u00a0What is wrong is the way my parents treated us and didn't give us the \u00a0emotional love that we all needed. \u00a0\n\n    \n\u00a0 \u00a0I would love if you would post this. I want everyone to know how \u00a0things really were. If you have any questions, I will be happy to \u00a0answer them. I want to the truth to get out there. Thank you so much \u00a0for sharing your story with us! Francesca Gruszie\n\n  \n27 Oct 2008 [posted 2012 Mar 19]",
